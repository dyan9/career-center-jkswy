  **WPC Career Center**
####Problem/Solution
Retention? / 4-Year Plan Web App

Define the problem:
	The WPC career center helps thousands of students every year with planning their career.  It is important for students to successfully transition from ASU into the workforce.  Students are often so busy with classes and deadlines that they lose track of their career oriented goals.  This means that by the time they are graduated, they are not necessarily prepared with appropriate resumes, interviewing skills, or professional attire.  The WPC career center is invested in student success.  In order for students to success, they must have access to the right tools to guide them.  With such a large quantity of students, it is hard to help all of them at once.  But with just the right website, we can provide them with all the tools they need for success.  The WPC center has used websites in the past, but they proved themselves to be unwieldy and hard to navigate.  Students reported having difficulty finding the tools they were looking for.  Students would often lose their patience with the website and discontinue use.  A website can’t help the students if they won’t use it.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to design a smooth and efficiently designed website that will be user friendly and will effectively help the students plan their career progression. This may include a list of former graduates by department and their current contact and career information.  

Solution:
The website we design must facilitate at least the following four areas of event planning: contacting a career coach, searching jobs/internship postings, informing students of events, and experience sharing.  Facilitating the interaction between the student and the career coach is very important.  Students often skip this step because it is not convenient.  We will include an appointment scheduling tool within the website.  Since each major has a different career coach, the website will help the student find the appropriate career coach and then find an appropriate time to meet.  This way the students will have 24/7 access to scheduling an appointment. Additionally, we will incorporate a tool for searching different job postings.  The website will also act as an event board, always showing the most current and upcoming events for students to attend.  Last of all, we want to include a function that helps students learn from the experiences.
